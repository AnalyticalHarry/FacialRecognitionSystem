# Facial Recognition System

## Author
Hemant Thapa

## Overview
This repository presents an open research study on facial recognition technology. The research leverages free and open-source tools, including Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV (cv2) Python libraries. The primary focus is on using Haar Cascade classifiers for detecting faces in images.

Facial recognition systems are designed to identify and verify faces within images. Given the complexity of human faces, the technology employs machine learning techniques to recognize and match thousands of facial features.

## Key Components

### OpenCV and Haar Cascade
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a comprehensive library of programming functions aimed at real-time computer vision. For facial recognition, OpenCV uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in images.

### Libraries Used
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Jupyter Notebook
